Chat-server is a modern chat app that uses Firebase, Tailwind css, React, and Typescript to let users communicate with each other in real-time using text messages. It has a friendly user interface that is easy to navigate. Typescript helps make the code more maintainable and scalable, while Tailwind css makes styling the app simpler with pre-built css classes. The app is also a progressive web application, which means that users can install it on their devices and use it offline.
